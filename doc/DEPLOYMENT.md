## Deployment
The development of our FitTrackr was a mostly front-end focused project. Most of our weekly sprints were dedicated to completing the functionality of our application
as we decided to assign the duty of setting up our back-end in later stages. 

Unfortunately issues would arise upon setting up our back-end and attemping to connect it to our front. 
Due to these issues, Group AA has decided we would not deploy our project as we decided to priorise in allocating our resources in addressing them.
